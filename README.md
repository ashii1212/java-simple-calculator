# Build a simple calculator

A console calculator. It shows a menu, reads two numbers and prints the answer with 2 decimals, like `12.00 + 3.50 = 15.50`.

The menu comes back after every answer, until the user picks Exit. A wrong menu number or dividing by zero prints a clear message, never a wrong answer.

## Features

- Show a menu: 1 Add, 2 Subtract, 3 Multiply, 4 Divide, 5 Exit.
- Read the user's choice and two numbers with `Scanner`.
- Print the result with 2 decimal places.
- Show the menu again after every calculation, until the user picks 5.
- For a choice outside 1 to 5, print a message and show the menu again.
- Never divide by zero: print `Cannot divide by zero.` instead.
